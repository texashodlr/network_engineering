	auto eth0
	iface eth0 inet static
	addr: 192.168.0.0

Some user stuff:
	whoami / id =[User ID, Primary Group ID, Groups]
	U/GID = 0 for root
	1-99 for predefined accounts
	100-999 for system + admin accounts
	gte 1000 f/users
cat /etc/passwd
	structure is: username:password:UID:GID:desription:homedir:shell
	
	logins with /sbin/nologin are for technical/admin accounts that don't need to login or perform actions interactively

	/etc/shadow contains more senstive information about users, format: username:password:[other nonsense]
		For pws, it's either hashed, * for no pw set, ! for pw was never set

	
	/etc/group --> group_name:password:GID:users_in_group (You can set pw's for groups)
	/etc/gshadow

Command 'which' shows where the executable is located for a certain command
	can do 'file $(which adduser)' -> choose adduser

	Using useradd:
		-d creates the homedir in a specified dir
		-m create the home dir
		-p password
		-s provide shell
		-c comments or description of the account
